h1. meme-py

A Python client API to consume "Yahoo! Meme's":http://meme.yahoo.com webservices on "YQL":http://developer.yahoo.com/yql.

This API is on an early phase of development and contributors are very welcome :) Just drop me a message at *guilherme dot chapiewski at gmail dot com*.

To understand how it works, please check the file "examples.py". We will have further documentation soon.
